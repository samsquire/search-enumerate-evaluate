# search-enumerate-evaluate

This is how you could implement a living document interface.

* Have a static list of document kinds
* Have a static list of operations for those document kinds.
* Label these two lists of things with a name and various metadata.
* Have searches generated by the frontend for operations using [User URLs](https://github.com/samsquire/user-urls)
